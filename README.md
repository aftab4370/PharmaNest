The current pharmaceutical sector is dealing withseveral issues. The pharmaceutical
sector nowadays isdominated by counterfeit medications. Health research fundinggroups
estimate that between 10 and 30 percent of thepharmaceuticals in the market are
counterfeited. Globally, thisfatal issue is creating several serious health risks. WHO
estimates that 30% of all medications worldwide are fake. In practically every region of
the world, this issue is becoming worse by the second. As drugs travel across several
scattered networks, it is challenging to identify fakes.


By integrating Blockchain technology into the network, the pharmaceutical supply chain
may be made safer. Every area of the network keeps track of the medications through a
record, making it possible to identify any introduction of fake medications. System
transparency and dependability are improved with Blockchain security. By employing
Blockchain technology, the initiative seeks to guarantee medicine quality, transaction
security, and data protection. By eliminating information about expired and fake
medications from the system, this effort increases system dependability and helps to make
the Blockchain a stable and widely used technology
